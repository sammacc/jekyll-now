    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To not only know, but fully understand Hex and binary, how to differentiate between them and how to convert them into dinary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I think I did reach my target, as I got all the answers that our teacher put up on the board correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt what Hex and Binary are and how to differentiate them between each other and dinary, by listening and watching intensely on the teacher's advice on how to differentiate between them and what the teacher said about them and how they worked.</td>

    <td>Not really much this lesson, as I thought I did quite well on learning and behavioural terms.
Although I should talk a bit less and not shout out the answers to the questions on the whiteboard.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will put my hand up for questions and will try my very best not to talk inside the lesson.</td>
