(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, as the google sheet is at the bottom of this blog. Although I managed to do this, I did not manage to get the google sheet to work. In all of the boxes where I put formula, it comes up with error.</td>

    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren't relevant.  

This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes (on paper) so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.</td>
