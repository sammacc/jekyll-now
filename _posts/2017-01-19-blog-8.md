    <td>Last week this  blogging page completely crashed, no tables no images, just the black writing of my previous blogs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>The most effective strategy in today's lesson, was definitely perseverance. I had to persevere through the difficult times, and believe me, there were A LOT of them. I also had to persevere through the incredibly boring times, at which I was on the verge of giving up, yet I did not. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Getting distracted was the main limit in the lesson today, as when I get bored I get distracted and I got bored a lot. Especially when I am stuck and have no clue in the world about what to do.</td>

    <td>Try and stay on the task at hand and if I feel like I am not understanding my target or I am stuck, I should ask for help, from my peers or my teacher.</td>
