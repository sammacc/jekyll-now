    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Last week I managed to insert a youtube video into my blog, but I do not really know how to insert a google sheet work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To insert my google sheet work into this blog.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, of course I reached my target, as the google sheet is at the bottom of this blog! Although I did not fulfil my task during the lesson.</td>

    <td>Perseverance was a key factor to completing this blog, as, even though I did not finish this task in class because I was not paying enough attention, I persevered at home. 

It took me ages trying to find how to embed my google sheet, in the end I just copied the URL and put it into this blog and it worked!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

This limited my learning, as if I payed enough attention I could have completed it in class.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will pay more attention to in the lesson, so that I can complete in class and ask for help from a teacher if I am stuck.</td>
