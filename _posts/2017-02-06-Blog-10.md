(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Definitely not, as my presentation had so many flaws in it that I have to do it against for next lesson and if it is not good, then I could get a detention.</td>

    <td>Most of the presentations did not fully explain the similarities between different cyphers, so it was hard to understand how to improve my work.</td>

    <td>Delete my presentation, make a new one, then add the information I got from asking questions about the similarities presentations and also add the information I got from other peopleâ€™s presentations.</td>
