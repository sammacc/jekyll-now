    <td>Listening is key, as if you didn't apply this strategy to your learning you would learn absolutely nothing.
Also, asking questions is another key feature towards your learning. You ask questions so that you know exactly what to do, so that you can produce your work to the standard that it should be.</td>

    <td>Talking, is an extremely bad habit to have. As, not only do you get told off, you also miss everything that is going on in the class. E.g: You are talking whilst the teacher is talking and when the teacher says,"now do your work‚Äù, you just sit there, puzzled, looking like a fool.</td>
