    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try and complete the following: 
Build a structural table around the writing.
Add in a background image.
Make the table white and a little bit transparent.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I focused a lot. Focusing is key, as if you did not focus you wouldn't know what to do during the lesson. Your piece of work, given to you by the teacher, will not be up to standards as you have no idea what to do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I still need to work on my habit of talking, which I am improving on. My concentration is getting better which is good as it allows me to fulfill my work to the absolute best of my abilities, which is also good as I will do well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will strive to control my habit of talking, which is improving, but I need to improve faster, not as slow as I'm going at the moment.</td>
